Official Creative Commons plugin for licensing your content. With Creative
Commons licenses, keep your copyright AND share your creativity.


== Description ==

The CreativeCommons WordPress plugin gives authors the ability to license
content with a Creative Commons license
([Choose a License](https://creativecommons.org/choose/)). With this plugin
you can:

* License your blog (single WordPress install)
* Display license for the site, posts and pages
* Prevent license changes per site (all pages on a site must use the same
  license)
* License your WordPress Network (WordPress Multisite install)
* License some of your sites differently in your WordPress Network
* Prevent license changes in your WordPress Network (all pages on all sites
  need to use the same license)
* License all your content with the same license (license per author)
* License some posts, pages, or images differently from your default license
  (per content license)
* License posts and pages by simply including CC Gutenberg blocks for each
  license required (Gutenberg License Blocks)
* Display license information with "One Click Attribution" for images

The default license used by the plugin is the Creative Commons
[Attribution-ShareAlike
(CC BY-SA)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. This can
be easily changed including attribution, depending on the permissions by a user
with the role: superadmin, site admin or author.

By default, the plugin will display a license in the footer of your theme. The
license plugin is also a widget, and can be dragged to any widget area like the
side-bar and all other available areas (this will suppress display of the
license in the theme footer and display it only in the widget area). We recommend
using the widget for better compatibility with your theme. You can use individual
licenses in posts or pages using Gutenberg blocks.

== Installation ==

1. Visit ‘Plugins > Add New’ and search for the plugin to install it. **OR**
   Upload the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. From the Widgets menu, drag the License widget to the widget area in which
   you would like the license to appear. Otherwise, the license will appear in
   the Wordpress footer area by default.
4. If you want to include licenses as Gutenberg blocks, simply add a new block,
   in the categories look for "Creative Commons Licenses" and add the required
   block.
